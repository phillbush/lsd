                                  lsd:
                             List Desktops

lsd(1) lists the number of desktops, the number of the current desktop,
and the number of windows per desktops.  Here's a sample output:

	$ lsd
	 2:Work
	-2:Web
	*1:Chat
	 0:Games
	 0:Other

Each line indicates a desktop, from 0 to the number of desktops minus 1
(in this example we have 5 desktops).  The current desktop is indicated
by an asterisk, the desktop with an urgent window is indicated by an
hyphen.  The number indicates the number of windows exclusively in this
desktop (windows that belongs to more than one desktop are ignored).
After the colon is the name of the desktop.

With an argument (such as -w), lsd watches for changes in the desktop
structure.  In this case, instead of being separated by lines, each
desktop info is separated by a tab, and each time new information is
queried a new information line is printed.

Why?
Because I need those information (current desk, windows per desk, etc)
for my bar script.  I once wrote a script that used xprop(1) to output
those information, but it took a whole second to run! Now rewritten in
C, it takes less than a tenth of a second.

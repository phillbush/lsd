                                  lsd:
                             List Desktops

lsd(1) lists the number of desktops, the number of the current desktop,
and the number of windows per desktops.  Here's a sample output:

	$ lsd
	 0:2
	 1:2
	*2:1
	 3:0
	 4:0

The first number indicates the desktop number, from 0 to the number of
desktops minus 1 (in this example we have 5 desktops).  The current
desktop is preceded by an asterisk.  Each desktop number is followed by
a colon and the number of windows exclusively in this desktop (windows
that belongs to more than one desktop are ignored).

Why?
Because I need those information (current desk, windows per desk, etc)
for my bar script.  I once wrote a script that used xprop(1) to output
those information, but it took a whole second to run! Now rewritten in
C, it takes less than a tenth of a second.
